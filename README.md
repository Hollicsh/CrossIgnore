# CrossIgnore
Tired of seeing the same trolls, boosters, or spam over and over?
**CrossIgnore** gives you a smarter ignore list that actually works the way you want it to. It keeps blocking past Blizzard’s ignore cap, handles cross-realm names, and adds a bunch of tools that make managing your ignore list painless instead of a chore.

The petty feature everyone secretly wanted

Ever had someone decline your group invite in LFG, only to see them pop up again five minutes later?
CrossIgnore can auto-ignore group leaders when you decline their invite.

It’s a little petty, sure — but it means you’ll never waste time re-declining the same boosters, GDKP leaders, or carry ads. One click, and they’re gone from your queue forever.

## What does the addon do?
- **Works across realms** – ignores always stick, even for `Name-Realm`.
- **Keeps going past the Blizzard limit** – when the built-in list is full, CrossIgnore just keeps adding to its own.
- **LFG integration** – optional “auto-ignore group leader when you decline” so you don’t see the same carry groups over and over.
- **Right-click menus everywhere** – unit frames, LFG list, etc. → quick “Ignore / Unignore / Edit Note / Set Expiry”.
- **Notes & expiries** – leave yourself a reminder (“spam,” “toxic,” “ninja”) and set a timer if you only want it to last a few days.
- **Smart chat filter** – blocks messages from ignored players, plus a per-channel word filter with a “strict” toggle so you don’t nuke half of trade chat by accident.
- **Blocks more than chat** – no more whispers, trades, duels, or group invites from people you’ve ignored.
- **Tooltip warning** – hover someone and see instantly if they’re on your list.
- **Global or per-character** – your choice.
- **Minimap icon/launcher** – for quick access (can be hidden).

## Why it’s better then other similar addons?
There are a bunch of ignore addons out there, but here’s what sets CrossIgnore apart:
- It doesn’t just stop when Blizzard’s list is full.
- Filtering is **targeted** — per channel, with optional strict matching — so you can nuke gold ads without breaking normal chat.
- It hooks right into the stuff you actually use (LFG, right-click menus, tooltips) so you don’t need slash commands for everything.
- Built to be lightweight and event-driven, so it’s not wasting memory or running background loops.

- Unlike other addons that claim to be lightweight, CrossIgnore actively clears up after itself — staying small and efficient even while blocking thousands of spam words in chat.

## Quick Commands## Quick Commands
/crossignore   – opens the UI

/ci - Opens the UI

/ci showMinimapIcon - Toggle the CrossIgnore icon on the minimap

- Uses the Ace3 framework + LibDBIcon for minimap/launcher support.
- Plays nicely with other addons — no hidden comms, no extra spam.
